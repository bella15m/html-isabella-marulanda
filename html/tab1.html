<h3>EXOPLANETS</h3>
<p>
  They are planets that orbit a star other than the sun and therefore do not
  belong to the solar system. Extrasolar planets became the object of scientific
  investigation in the 20th century.
  <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
  _TYPES OF EXOPLANETS_
  <br />-Jovian: Gas giants that may be larger than Jupiter, with some subtypes,
  such as the so-called cold Neptune or super-Jupiter.<br />
  <br />-Terrestrial: Solid planets, similar to terrestrial planets.<br />
  <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
  _FUN FACTS_
  <br />-A short time ago, NASA discovered a solar system made up, not by one,
  but by 7 different planets orbiting around its star.<br />
  <br />-The exoplanets with the highest similarity index to planet Earth are:
  Kepler-296e (93% similarity) and Kepler-395c (91% similarity)<br />
  <br />-More than 4,100 exoplanets are known so far, which are very difficult
  to see directly with telescopes.<br />

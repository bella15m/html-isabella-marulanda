<h3>THE TEMPERATURE OF THE STARS</h3>
<p>
  <br />
  •Stars are currently classified into spectral classes identified using the
  letters-O-B-A-F-G-K-M-A sequence ranging from the hottest (type 0) to the
  coldest (type m) <br /><br />• The cold stars, that is to say, those of
  spectral types k and M, radiate most of their energy in the red zone in the
  infrared of the electromagnetic spectrum and that is why they are seen in
  color , while the hot stars, that is, those of type O and B, emit most of
  their radiation at wavelengths from blue to ultraviolet, making them appear
  blue or white <br /><br />• Blue stars are among the most Hot and the rarest
  in the universe, their life is relatively short compared to the type of most
  abundant stars in the universe, red dwarfs, which, being small, can live for
  hundreds of billions of years<br />
  <br />
  spectral class<br />
  <br />O= 28.000 - 50.000k - Azul oscuro <br />
  <br />B= 9.600 - 28.000k - Azul claro <br />
  <br />A= 7.100 - 9.600k - Blanco <br />
  <br />F= 5.700 - 7.100k - Amarillo claro<br />
  <br />G= 4.600 - 5.700k - Amarillo oscuro<br />
  <br />K= 3.200 - 4.600k - Naranja<br />
  <br />M= 1.700 - 3.200K - Rojo<br />

  who discovered the temperature of the stars <br />
  <br />Cecilia Helena Payne-Gaposchkin. At the age of 25 she had determined the
  temperatures and chemical compositions of the stars, finding that hydrogen and
  helium were their essential components. The result of this research conflicted
  with the belief at the time that stars had a chemical composition similar to
  Earth.<br />
